## Introduction

Go, also known as Golang, is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google. It is known for its simplicity, efficiency, and excellent support for concurrent programming. This repository will guide you through the basics and some advanced concepts of Go.

## Installation

To get started with Go, you need to install it on your machine. Follow the steps below to install Go:

1. **Download Go**: Go to the [official Go download page](https://golang.org/dl/) and download the installer for your operating system.
2. **Install Go**: Run the installer and follow the instructions.
3. **Verify Installation**: Open a terminal and type the following command to verify that Go is installed correctly:
    ```sh
    go version
    ```

## Getting Started

Once you have Go installed, you can start writing your first Go program. Follow these steps:

1. **Create a Workspace**: Create a directory for your Go workspace. For example:
    ```sh
    mkdir go-workspace
    cd go-workspace
    ```
2. **Write Your First Program**: Create a new file named `hello.go` and add the following code:
    ```go
    package main

    import "fmt"

    func main() {
        fmt.Println("Hello, Go!")
    }
    ```
3. **Run Your Program**: Open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing `hello.go`, and run the program using:
    ```sh
    go run hello.go
    ```
